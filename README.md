Data Management Site
====================

The contents of this project will live at:

    www.library.nd.edu/data-management

The main library website is built using SHTML. To keep things as simple as
possible this project is built in the same way.

In order to deploy this project all we *should* have to do is copy the contents
of the `data-management` directory to the main webserver.

A copy of the main SSI files has been brought into the project for local
testing. An example apache config file is also included in the project.
